# Project_Sentiment_Analysis-531
The process started by data collection from Yelp website and then various steps performed like data preprocessing,
feature selection using TF-IDF, Training and test division. Then different algorithms such as
Support Vector Machine(SVM), Na√Øve Bayes and multilayer perceptron(Artificial Neural
network) applied on this dataset prior to final system implementation.

The final system is built upon Support Vector Machine(SVM) which came out to be the best among three algorithms.
SVM proved to be a very robust algorithm with high accuracy. The dataset divided into test and
training set. Model is first trained using the training dataset and then it predicts the sentiment
from the test dataset. 

Model validation is also an important part of sentiment analysis. Various 
model validation methods like holdout, Confusion Matrix and Classification Report applied. The
system seems to predict positive and negative emotion reasonably well based on the dataset
available. 

The future scope includes implementing a hybrid approach, training data on a larger
dataset and implementing sarcasm detection.
