Mind you, my husband loves you guys and eats there all of the time. After a busy day.  I just wanted to relax and eat. We decided on pick up from Chipotle. \n\nI got a bowl, with chicken, steak and tofu with the works. I asked for everything. Including guacamole. \nI dug into my meal and I could immediately taste the lime that was used on the white rice. Which is great because most fast food places don't really hold up to their quality. It's nice to know that, Chipotle does.\nThe chicken, steak and tofu were cooked perfectly and my entire bowl was fantastic. I ate the whole damn thing.\n\nOn a side note. I see a lot of people complaining about the line and the wait times. People, it's simple. Download the FREE app. Order, wait 10 to 15 minutes and then go wait 5 minutes to pick up your food. I mean, the Yelp app is free, instead of leaving terrible reviews because of the long line. Download the free app and just order a head. I didn't wait but 3 minutes. Paid and left.

Let me amend that as of today and another visit by saying the food has reached the distinction of being terrible to my taste buds as well. This place will be lucky to exist next year if it doesn't get shut down this year. It seriously needs an entirely new crew to come in and rescue it.\n\nI live less than a mile for this location and was thrilled when I heard last year that we were getting a new Burger King so close. Ironically, it's right across the street where the former Burger King (now Brighton Hot Dog Shoppe) was. For the first couple of weeks that it was open, it was impossible to get near. The drive-thru lanes were always backed up and the rest of the traffic for the restaurant literally went into main road. I know, it's Burger King. Not worth that much fuss.\n\nYesterday (1\/6\/18) was my first visit. I went through the drive-thru and apart from them putting onions on my Whopper when I asked them not to, the order was fine and the burger and fries were as good as any other BK I've visited. So far, so good.\n\nHowever, I returned today (1\/7\/18) and went inside at 2:41 PM. The place was an absolute disaster. It's a smaller location, so there's not as much room as all the other BKs I've been to. But there was one cashier with a line of people already five or six deep, an unruly manager yelling at the crew constantly, and all the other staff just seemingly confused, not listening, or not bothered enough to do their jobs.\n\nOrders in front of mine were filled wrong multiple times. The cashier kept punching in orders incorrectly and had to be corrected by the customers. The manager was too busy yelling at everyone and getting in a hurry that he wasn't even paying attention to what was going on and just throwing orders out to the counter, one of which wasn't even completely filled. He wound up bagging mine as a take out order even though it clearly stated that it was for dine in. \n\nIt shouldn't have been that unruly. It was a regular after lunch crowd on a Sunday with nowhere near a crazy drive-thru line. Once I finally got my order, I went back and sat down all the way in the back of the dining room because it was literally one of the few tables that was clean. 95% of the other tables had sticky stuff on them, or hadn't been wiped down in general. There was one table that had a cup on it that whole time I was there and remained there when I left. Whomever's it was had left long before I arrived.\n\nThe floor near me had a huge half wet-half dried soda spill on the floor under the table. The walls were filthy with black, brown, and white smudges. The men's bathroom had a leftover ketchup cup on the soap dispenser, white streaked residue on the walls, a dirty floor and a urinal with old toilet paper in it. To top it off there are two already broken stools in the dining area.\n\nTHIS PLACE HASN'T EVEN BEEN OPEN A MONTH.\n\nPics are included of all the offenses. The kitchen was no better, with knocked over bun trays near the back, with bun halves and other debris on the floor, along with some brooms. I wasn't able to get a picture of that, but you can see how the front end cup service next to the soda fountain looked.\n\nIt's a shame. This place is brand new and already neglected. The staff are obviously not trained well and not trained enough. The manager on duty needed to learn to catch his breath and not create more confusion and getting orders wrong on top of orders that were already wrong. Until this place gets its act together, I won't be going back in. They had a full staff and not one crew member was even looking to clean up the place. It wasn't that busy that this should have happened.","address":"2379 Noblestown Rd","attributes":null,"categories":"Restaurants, Burgers","city":"Pittsburgh","hours":null,"is_open":1,"latitude":40.4264222,"longitude":-80.0562239,"name":"Burger King","postal_code":"15205","review_count":13,"Overall_Rating":1.0,"state":"PA"},{"business_id":"Ci8mH1OTVhH-kl2Cq8-QNQ","date":"2018-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","User_Rating":1,"text":"If I could give it zero stars I would.

When people overheard that I bought the water outside and how cheap it was compared to McDonald's pricing, several left the line and headed outside to get a drink.\n\nWill I ever set foot back inside here?

I got a regular fries and nacho cheese, not the supreme. Ok, let that slide. Honest mistake. Then got to my chili cheese burrito ... what a joke that ended up being. I had more of the tortilla than anything else. Usually they're bursting and the chili cheese gets all over the place. Best part of it. It was as thin as can be. Anorexic chili cheese burrito. Our food ended up being cold and all the tacos ended up being a basic salad! Hardly any meat on anything. Looks like I'll be going to the Columbia road location.

One of the major components in my life that it needs to function! \n\nNeeding coffee this was the only Starbucks here, so here I am in line! The line is three deep and the damn Starbucks customer service is so fantastic that its fanatical. The over friendly Target\/Starbucks employee is so nice that it's disgusting this early! Damn! I need less talk and more coffee! All of the um, and shrugs are pointing in one direction from the crowd of coffee people behind me too! Less talk and more hustle hustle in the morning to make sure that the coffee is in my hand! \n\nThe store was highly organized and the Starbucks employee was in the best mood ever! Damn her energy level was off the top! She was highly motivated to make all of her customers comfortable and feel welcomed. She just needs to know that speed should be her friend. Especially this early in the morning. Having had no coffee this over excess chatter was cumbersome! I appreciate her extra care and service but damn less talk and a lot more action. The action that I'm talking about is the coffee that should be in my hand!\n\nI decided to have the salted caramel mocha in the grande size with added extra caramel and whip! All of the coffee tasted fantastic too! And it was so painful to watch her make it since she moved fast but with a pace that was not focused on what she was doing! She kept giving her opinion of the drink as she made it! Target should consider her for the sales of their company! Anyways back to coffee! After the last comment about how she and I share the same tastes of extra caramel on top I was given my refreshing coffee beverage.\n\nNirvana finally has arrived! The mix of mocha and sweet delectable caramel quells yet another possible \"out of character\" moment! Thanks coffee for keeping me sane all these years. I have to say that my patience level is very high and I tolerate a lot, probably because of the twins! Lol! This morning I was border, a race car in the red.... ! Now that the coffee is half gone and in my system I think that I'm good! Not great, with more coffee comes that greatness! \n\nI did not sample from the pastries today, the waiting game was the hardest part. Really how long would of it been for a sandwich? Let's not do that? My most excellent cheri had an Americano. He had this iced and added his own fixings. I was the one that waited for the coffee to be made; by the way. He walked away and wanted to leave because of the wait. With all the patience in my court and wanting Starbucks I needed there sweet essence this morn! A bit trying in the patience department. For sure!\n\nWill I return, not in the morning time when I \"need\" and \"long\" for my coffee! If I was just casually shopping and doing running around this is a great little store. The store is so clean and the staff way tres outgoing and friendly. Considering the area which outside the store is not the best area! They have done a fantastic job at keeping this store so amazing and awesome! Bravo there. The reason for the four stars is for the speed of service which should be the utmost priority. I timed how long that it took to make my coffee from the order until I had it . It was eight minutes. This is Starbucks loosing money, not that she was not amazing, but her speed needs to improve!

Why? I've had the Starbucks app for a few years now, but only just recently have I opened the app and see these mini-game like challenges that promise to reward enough \"stars\" to make the effort worthwhile.\n\nSo on a recent challenge to make back-to-back-to-back daily purchases for bonus \"stars\" I visited this convenient 24-hour location near the Las Vegas Blvd\/Windmill intersection last night. Placed the order via the mobile app, so I wouldn't have to explain any customization I want on my order (Iced Coffee, no ice, 1 sugar in the raw, and Trenta, the largest size it comes in) and save some time in the process. I think it is a pretty easy order to prepare.\n\nI only waited like a minute after arriving. The place was dead, only one guy on his scooter ordering from the drive through window, 3 people reading or on their laptop at their individual tables, and at least two baristas on staff. So A+ for the friendly & speedy service. But it was prepared with \"regular\" ice, which I didn't bother to have them fixed. Since I was still debating about picking up dinner at a nearby restaurant that would be closing in another 30 minutes.\n\nAnyway, mistakes happen. Iced coffee is still iced coffee. I still scored 75 bonus stars. 50 more if I buy something today.

Or the most convenient if you're leaving LV (sad face) and you're headed to the 15fwy.  There isn't a massive amount of parking but I had no problem finding some.  They were out of the strawberry acai refresher but it's probably because of the high traffic and the summer approaching.  the staff was real nice and they made me another drink super quick.

The only consistency I find at Starbucks is they are very inconsistent. For the great variety they offer, I kept trying the company and going to different locations but they suck. For this specific trip, they couldn't properly pour water in the oatmeal. They filled it with such a small amount, it wouldn't get all the ingredients wet. I walked up to the front for more water but nobody would help me.

I love trying different locations every now and then just to switch things up. I was in the area filling up for gas to make this 4hr drive to Los Angeles when I realized I didn't have my coffee for the day! This Starbucks just happen to be on my way to the I-15. I was a bit confused at first by the set up of the drive-thru but eventually figured it out. You know when they are located in these shopping plaza strip malls the drive-thru set ups can be a bit bizarre! I was apprehensive at first because the amount of cars that were sitting however they moved very quick. The barista that was taking orders was super cool and joking with me thru the intercom I thought it was funny. Upselling with a bit of sense of humor was cool. I ordered a Venti and he was like \"Ugh just get the Trenta size you know you want it\". The Starbucks app just happened to be down and I couldn't do a reload. The barista took the extra steps to help me reload manually and made an effort to say that I needed to earn my stars. Little things like that can always create a memorable experience for a customer.

Like most Starbucks locations, a lot of the desserts in the pastry case sell out a lot, which is not good when you have a 9:30 pm craving for lemon pound cake. The staff are always respectful, quick, and friendly which is great because in some locations I've had staff members scream at me that they don't have the secret menu. Speaking of the secret menu, I recommend \"The Pink Drink\" (now not so much of a secret) which is a strawberry a\u00c3\u00a7a\u00c3\u00ad refresher with coconut milk instead of water. Quite delicious! Another tip is that if you have a dog (Or a kid or a craving) you can ask for a free puppuccino! What a puppuccino basically is, is a cup of whipped cream with caramel sauce.

One on Christmas Day. I couldn't believe that they were open but for coffee-aholics such as myself, I guess Starbucks wanted to steer clear of harmful detox issues. How humane. \n\nWith that being said, the girl at the front counter was hardly the usual chipper cashiers that I have grown accustomed to. This one was clearly not amused she was working on Christmas day. I call it the \"stunning personality, get out of retail syndrome\". It's my karmic relief from having worked in retail\/retail management for over twenty years. On days such as a holiday, when you work for the MAN you show up and put your best face forward. Your time-and-a-half\/double time is your master. Your happy to be employed, dammit! Pigtails was having none of it. I asked about if they no longer carried the larger sized water. Dunno. \n\nGood stuff is that these guys are some of the hardest working people in town. The coffee is usually consistent.  I hate getting a Cinnamon Dolce Latte that tastes like glorified water. Not here. \n\nMore negatives is as others have reported, the trash is usually overflowing outside and in the back area, which it was today. There was also a stack of supplies in the corner which seems to be the place to put the overflow supplies due to insufficient room. Nonetheless, not too aesthetically pleasing to say the least.\n\nMore good stuff: Colton was a rockstar barrista in and out of the drive thru. He will be missed. There is usually room to get some quite time in at this location without being disturbed that your loitering. Being gold status allows for free coffee\/tea refills. Score.","address":"6120 N.

People have no common sense and will cut off cars in line the correct way.. now with sprouts coming soon it will only get worse.  The quality of drinks have gone way down since colton(sp?) left.

If you order online and the item is out of stock (which seems to be half the items on the menu) they will just steal your money... they dont refund it they just put your cup up there without your other items and you still pay for what they were out of and you gotta actually ask for your money. \n\nAs previously stated this used to be the \"go to\" location for the northwest since they opened up... now its a very stressful experience... they need some way to remedy the drive through multiple lines crap and they need to bring in some better baristas with a better sense of quality control.","address":"6120 N.

I don't have to wait in their long lines anymore.  Thank goodness for technology.  Starbucks is really consistent with their Americano and that's my go-to drink.

Take for instance, a Subway 6-inch. When I am in the mood for food to carry me over for a few hours, a 6-inch Subway sub does the job. \n\n   Lately Subway is a fantastic value. This is the era of the daily $3 6-inch Sub of the Day. Corresponding to each day of the week there is a feature sub for $3. With a 21 ounce drink it comes out to around $5.20. \n\n  This is the closest Subway to my residence. Over the years that date back prior to the birth of my Yelp profile I have caught this Subway's act.  It is more than the subs that I enjoyed. It was also their fountain Strawberry Fanta. Before the Coke Freestyle machines were around this was one of the few restaurants in my neighborhood that offered strawberry Fanta. Throughout the years my experiences here were three stars. The common denominators in my experiences were one or two people working in the restaurant and consistency in good subs. \n\n   In recent times during the Daily $3 Sub of the Day Era, my experiences here continue to be three stars. My most recent subs were the meatball marinara and tuna. They are so clear in my conscious that I could talk about the past two visits in more detail. \n\n   Before I even describe my recent experiences inside this Subway, there are a few words about outside. The shopping center it sits in is poorly laid out. The Subway parking spaces are in a poor location where vehicles back up to the traffic signal at Green Valley Parkway causing the parking spaces to be blocked on. I always park further away by Green Valley Grocery or Bank of America to avoid being blocked in. \n\n   Inside Subway there are plenty of tables. Finding a table has never been a problem. Fast service on the other hand is a slight problem. \n\n  There has been one or two people running this Subway. Today there was genuinely one person running it because the woman doing all the work was training the new guy. The upshot is that during peak periods the woman running the business still has two hands. When she is both sandwich artist and cashier, speed slows to a crawl. What could you do? If there were three people working here, I doubt they would see $3 6-inch Sub of the Days. These employees have always been pleasant and hard working. \n\n    Today I ordered the tuna fish sub on Italian bread. I requested that the sandwich artist toast it in the microwave. As a sandwich artist, she did not hold back on the toppings. I requested every topping with the exception of pickles and banana peppers plus extra mayonnaise. For a quarter more than you'd pay for a cup of coffee nearby at Mothership Coffee, this sub was $3 well spent. Going back a few weeks prior I ordered the meatball marinara. This meatball marinara was similar to the one I recently ate in the Pebble Marketplace Subway, where the bread crumbled causing the meatball to fall out and consequently turning into my version of dirty dining where sauce gets all over my hands. Besides that it was a tasty sub with a sporadic serving of meatballs sharing the Italian bread with provolone cheese, onions, olives, and tomatoes. \n\n   The $3 Sub of the Day Deal really fits the catchphrase of Subway making it your way. When I am in the vicinity of Green Valley Parkway at Subway Road and want something to fill me over for a few hours, this Subway hits the spot.","address":"2620 N Green Valley Pkwy","attributes":{"RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","NoiseLevel":"u'loud'","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","GoodForKids":"True","RestaurantsAttire":"u'casual'","Caters":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","BikeParking":"True","WiFi":"u'no'","Alcohol":"u'none'","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","HasTV":"False","OutdoorSeating":"False","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': True, 'breakfast': True}","Ambience":"{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","RestaurantsReservations":"True"},"categories":"Restaurants, Sandwiches, Fast Food","city":"Henderson","hours":{"Monday":"0:0-0:0","Tuesday":"0:0-0:0","Wednesday":"0:0-0:0","Thursday":"0:0-0:0","Friday":"0:0-0:0","Saturday":"0:0-0:0","Sunday":"0:0-0:0"},"is_open":1,"latitude":36.0694834,"longitude":-115.081951,"name":"Subway","postal_code":"89014","review_count":25,"Overall_Rating":3.0,"state":"NV"},{"business_id":"duVhqYoC-wIbsgv1SoqVDg","date":"2016-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","User_Rating":4,"text":"Being in a casino \"food court,\" you'd expect the prices to be higher or outlandish here.

There are many other locations close by that I will gladly take the extra few minutes to drive to receive a 5 Star drink and 5 Star customer service.","address":"2050 North Dobson Road","attributes":{"RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","BikeParking":"True","OutdoorSeating":"True","WiFi":"u'free'","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","Caters":"True"},"categories":"Food, Coffee & Tea","city":"Chandler","hours":{"Monday":"4:0-21:30","Tuesday":"4:0-21:30","Wednesday":"4:0-21:30","Thursday":"4:0-21:30","Friday":"4:30-21:30","Saturday":"4:30-21:30","Sunday":"4:0-21:30"},"is_open":1,"latitude":33.335506,"longitude":-111.87813,"name":"Starbucks","postal_code":"85224","review_count":33,"Overall_Rating":2.5,"state":"AZ"},{"business_id":"SlJ-QKT1KG7PfA0JZYKgHA","date":"2018-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","User_Rating":5,"text":"Phyllis was super helpful when she patiently explained to my half-awake self the differences between the nitro and regular cold brew.

We get the same drinks every single time at every single store, usually twice a day at the same stores. It comes out to the same price every single time at every single store , so I don't know why we have to argue the price every single time. Last week my fiance got so mad he just left without the coffee because the manager\/kid was so rude. \n \nToday, my drink had so much ice in it, I couldn't even get the straw in! I'm pretty sure the manager \/ kid recognized my fiance and that's why I had so much ice in there. I know for a fact that if you use the appropriate scoop for each size drink, that's not an issue. I worked at Starbucks for four years, I have no idea why it's so difficult for these stores in Vegas to have some consistency!! Really sad.

He proceeded to ask his fellow coworker for help and when she arrived she looked at me with a puzzled look as well which made me feel awkward so I asked, 'is there something wrong?' and she then pointed to a scanning device and said 'that's where you're suppose to scan it!'. I then apologized and said 'I haven't come into your location, I normally just go through your drive thru so I'm sorry I didn't know.' and she just walked away. \n\nThe gentleman who originally helped me then asked if I needed anything else and I asked if they wouldn't mind breaking a $50 bill for me. The gentleman looked at his coworker (the same one who helped him) and asked if he had enough in his register to change my bill and she began to tell him that he did but I would need to buy something. I said, 'Thank you, and handed them 2 chocolates that would've cost $1.80 for both and she then looked at me and said, 'You are going to need to buy more than that!'. I'm not going to lie, I chuckled because I'm thinking to myself - you just said that he had enough money in his drawer to change it and if he didn't, a simple 'No' would've sufficed! \nTo bring humor into the situation I asked, 'How much exactly did you want me to spend when all I am looking for is change that you said he had enough for?!' and she said 'More than that!'. \n\nI began to laugh and said, 'Never mind, thanks anyway!' and moved to the other side to wait for my drink. \nWhen they handed it to me, I thanked them for it and normally with great customer service; you thank the customer and invite them to come back in which the barista who handed it to me did no such thing. All he did was walk away! \n\nThe biggest problem about this entire occurrence which is my fault is that I failed to get their names which will not be a problem for me to retrieve.

We start to walk away when she came from behind the counter and started yelling at my husband that he was rude for leaving the lid on the counter.  She yelled at him in front of all the customers.  Then proceeded to yell that people aren't his servant.  This infuriated me that not only is she the one being rude, but that there's also still a long line of customers and she ignores all of them to come and make ignorant statements.

She didn't do what I would have done if I was in her position working in the food industry.  It was a technicality for over charging me.  It doesn't even come out of the store, it's Chipotle company deals for members.   I came in today, because I wanted to use my BOGO before it expires.  I also have been waiting to try out the online order.  I normally order in person two entrees with guacamole on the side with the meals.  When I did the order online, it asks me if I wanted my guacamole on the side, I clicked on it.  When I came into the store, I noticed I was charged a little more with my BOGO.  It wasn't half the bill.  She charged me for 2 entrees with two side orders of guacamole instead of guacamole within my entree.  When I look online on my order receipt, it's shown the guacamole is within the entree not a side order.  I told her that, she said I can't order like that.  Next time order with the guacamole and side note to type there I want it on the side.  I told here there isn't a section to do that.  She kept telling me there is one.  I can't be crazy....I just checked before writing this review... there isn't a section for that.  All of this for $1.95 guacamole.  I told her ok whatever.  It's a simple fix, it's a technicality charge.  What pissed me off even more, when I got home, one of my entree was missing cheese.... I would say the communication with the online order is not good experience.  I was overcharged more  for technicality and my order isn't correct.  Good thing, she checked the order again before handing it to me, because there was a missing guacamole.  \n\nThat's one.... now a week ago I was here again.  I came in with no one in front of me ordering.  But right after I ordered one burrito and a bowl, the line started to build up.  I can tell the server started to get irritated while she was doing me order.  It was the fajita veggies on both entrees that got me.  It was old looking and empty, the girl literally grabbed one bell pepper and 3 onion stings for the burrito and the same for the bowl.  I even asked her can I have a little more and she just added 2 onion stings... can't she just grab a fresh one?  Then she turned around and yelled at her coworkers, \"I need help!\"  Every ingredients they had were low, they made my two entrees really light than usual, I didn't bother to keep asking for more for every ingredient.  \n\nI'm going to go to the other location on Rainbow to try it out.

We've been here a couple of times, and both times were really good. The front counter area is well-organized and fully stocked with items (chips, boxes, catering supplies). Chipotle is pretty much a staple for our family, and we usually visit a couple weekends a month. If we miss it, my hubby gets withdrawals. Yes, really.\n\nThe food trays were filled halfway or more (a good sign, more fresh). More food prep and cooking was under way (sizzling, mmm). The staff is nice. This is a clean restaurant overall. Music is playing (twice, one type for the customers, one type for the employees making the food). We've chosen the same booth for both past visits, near the counter. This location is sort of bare-bones (but that's ok) with overall decor, not much is hanging on the walls. Most locations are industrial- feeling with exposed pipe type ceilings, a mix of metal and unfinished natural wood (the one @ Decatur\/Sahara is a good representation of most restaurants in this chain). \n\nMy favorite bowl is composed of: white rice, either Chorizo or Chicken, depending on my mood, black beans, fajita veggies, corn, some cheese, some sour cream, and lettuce. I used to get salsa but I split the bowl with my son, and he said it was \"too hot.\" Sometimes, I get it on the side. I was just thinking that my son must be growing up because he hasn't been saying \"Mum-mum\" which is his code phrase for \"More, please.\" But I heard it yesterday, so, it was a highlight, to hear it. He loves Chipotle. Once he hears we're going, he thinks we're going right then and there. It is a joy when our picky eater can eat something with such ferocity and enthusiasm.  \n\nAlso does online ordering and catering.

Horrible service. September has a special that kids eat free on Sundays. We were there because my nephew wanted to eat chipotle for his birthday today. We ordered one for our child that was in her stroller and was being watched by my mother-in-law.  The lady said we needed to be charged for the kids meal because we didn't have the child with us. Then they had the nerve to speak to each other in Spanish about the kids meal ordeal. Just because I'm of different ethnicity, don't assume we can't speak Spanish and don't talk s*** in front of customers in a different language. As we were at the register they informed us that we had to pay for the kids meal. We showed the child and asked if there was a issue, they told us no and said that the kids meal is normally for older children, granted the child was a little over 1. I don't see anything wrong with feeding mashed beans to a 1 year old. Also I didn't see that there was a stipulation to the age of a child to qualify for a kids meal. After we settled that issue, the guy at the register came up to us and stated our card was declined so we showed our receipt and cleared up that issue.

I was astonished by the amount of attitude she gave me when I told her my friends and were paying separately for our drinks, such a simple thing that she was so bothered by.

Not caring about service because they have you addicted. 50% of time I am disappointed with this location.","address":"5200 S Fort Apache","attributes":{"BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","GoodForKids":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","Ambience":"{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","Alcohol":"'none'","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","OutdoorSeating":"False","RestaurantsReservations":"False","WiFi":"'free'","HasTV":"False","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"},"categories":"Restaurants, Fast Food, Food, Coffee & Tea, Burgers","city":"Las Vegas","hours":{"Monday":"5:30-0:0","Tuesday":"5:30-0:0","Wednesday":"5:30-0:0","Thursday":"5:30-0:0","Friday":"5:30-0:0","Saturday":"5:30-0:0","Sunday":"5:30-0:0"},"is_open":1,"latitude":36.094155,"longitude":-115.293886,"name":"McDonald's","postal_code":"89148","review_count":25,"Overall_Rating":2.5,"state":"NV"},{"business_id":"9dz6ZYUDCqtD67LSPTLApQ","date":"2017-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","User_Rating":1,"text":"I don't normally do reviews unless it's bad and I don't expect a lot with fast food but this time was horrible. So I got off of work and came to this McDonald seeing as they are always open. Always have the full menu available. Well at this time they did not, they only had the breakfast menu available. So I go ahead and order the sausage egg with cheese biscuit. The person running it, when ordering they ended up going to their fellow coworker and saying \"I'm done\". First of all I found that very disrespectful Second of all being as somebody who associate themselves with customers all day I expect nothing more then 100% regardless if you're about to go on break, if you're about to get off of work it doesn't matter to me, what matters to me is customer satisfaction. (If you are about to get off work or going on break, finish the customer who u handling and then go to break or whatever). So besides that I went home and I unwrap my sausage egg with cheese biscuit and I find myself with bottom bread, cheese and sausage with no top bread nor egg;  as you'll see in the picture I am highly disappointed in this and I doubt I will ever come back to this McDonald's. I wish I would've gotten the kids name who was disrespectful to me so I can properly talk to him but seeing as he left so quickly I wasn't able to but I will be sure to tell my fellow coworkers and friends not to come here again seeing apparently to this McDonald's customer satisfaction is not what your guys goal is to obtain.

Without ever looking at me, he said \"ok\" and walked away.  \n\nI contacted customer support and reported my experience.  I was told someone would be contacting me to follow up.  This email is their entire idea of \"follow up\":\n\nDear Thomas,\n\nThank you for taking the time to provide us with your feedback. I would like to apologize to you for the late service that you have recently received.  At Papa John's, we strive for best in class in everything we do.  One of our core values at Papa John's is constant improvement.  \n\nWe want to make it right. We do not take these issues lightly and your feedback will be used to improve our ability to serve you in the future.\n\nSincerely,\n\nstore 1686        \nGeneral Manager\nRound Rock Restaurant Group\n\nI replied to the email and have never heard from them again.  There is way too much competition out there for this place to stay in business.  Help shut them down and show them that people will not accept such horrendous service.  \n\nTom Murphy","address":"4302 E Ray Rd, Ste 113","attributes":{"GoodForKids":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"False","Ambience":"{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"False","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","NoiseLevel":"u'average'","WiFi":"u'no'","Alcohol":"u'none'","Caters":"True","HasTV":"False","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","OutdoorSeating":"False"},"categories":"Restaurants, Pizza","city":"Phoenix","hours":{"Monday":"10:0-23:0","Tuesday":"10:0-23:0","Wednesday":"10:0-23:0","Thursday":"10:0-23:0","Friday":"10:0-0:0","Saturday":"10:0-0:0","Sunday":"10:0-23:0"},"is_open":1,"latitude":33.3203504,"longitude":-111.9918903,"name":"Papa John's Pizza","postal_code":"85044","review_count":19,"Overall_Rating":3.0,"state":"AZ"},{"business_id":"BNLFEPZTyhNObVzXsTT0iw","date":"2017-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","User_Rating":2,"text":"Ordered the valentines pizza special it was gross.

They took an unusually long amount of time to get us our food in the drive through, and when we got our food we had barely any sauce even though we had four people. When we asked for more sauce she literally gave us ONE more packet of sauce. Even her co-worker questioned what she did, as it was terrible customer service, saying \"That's it?!,\" and she replied \"If they want more they can get it.\" Seeing as the other employee seemed nice, we didn't want to be rude so we pulled around and I went inside and grabbed more sauce. But it doesn't end there, once we got home we realized that we we're missing a burrito that we had PAYED for. We called the restaurant to make a complaint and the supposed manager picked up and it was the same lady who gave us one packet of sauce at the drive through, \"Dory,\" if that's even her real name. She wouldn't tell us who her higher up was, probably because she knows what she did wrong, and when we asked for her last name she wouldn't tell us that either, \"just Dory,\" she said. We asked who her district manager was and she was hesitant but gave us the name Mark, just Mark. No last name again, so now we asked for his last name and really hesitantly this time, as if thinking, said District. Mark District... I'm not sure if that's a real name or not, she gave me plenty of reason to believe it isn't, but I plan on finding out. After that we had had enough and simply hung up.

My wife and I have been buying drinks at McDonald's for years and always get refills. He let me know that a customer can get as many refills as they would like while in the building but once they leave the building then they cannot get a refill. I explained to him that if that was the policy then the other locations are not following the policy. His location is the only one. He said that he did not care what the other locations were doing. This was the policy and he would not let me get refills. \n\nAs I left the McDonald's, I told the manager that he just lost my business. He said that was fine and did not seem to care about that.

McDonald's is not consistent in their policy. \n\nI placed a complaint with McDonald's Corporate. They had a Director of Operations give me a call about the complaint.

I'd say about 8\/10 orders I receive from this location is wrong or they just don't put the order together completely. Last 3 orders have been missing something. On one order, we ordered a fairly large order, about 8 different burgers. Of those, we asked for one Big Mac with no cheese. They didn't put cheese on ANY of them. In fact one we got ended up being a quarter pounder with just the bun, patty and pickles, nothing else. Nasty. \nThe other complaint I have is half the time, the attitude is far from friendly. I wouldn't say rude, just that couldn't be bothered kind of attitude, and that probably contributes to the messed up orders. \nSome people think that this kind of work deserves $15\/hr. Those people are delusional. It's not the type of job that deserves that. Most people working at McD's are kids or students. Some management positions maybe, but not the average employee. Paramedics, paralegals, and other more important type of jobs don't pay that much. \nStill have problems. This is a complaint for July 21, 2016. Ordered a few things. One was a plain fish filet, then a couple Big Macs and a couple mcdoubles. \nFirst the filet. Specifically ordered a plain Filet o Fish, even saying to them 'all I want is the fish and the bun.' Got everything, tarter sauce, cheese etc. \nSo I asked them to fix it, again saying specifically how it should be- just the filet and the bun. Nothing else. So this time it had cheese on it. Really?!??!!! Luckily, the third time was the charm. \nNext the Big Mac. They forgot that middle piece of the bun when they were putting it together, so they just put it on top, then put the 'lid' piece on top of that. Wow. \nIt is clear that this location will never bother to fix their employee problem. I went back and read other reviews about this location, and it is staggering to me that after numerous complaints about the same reoccurring problems, they still haven't fixed the problems yet. I figured with a big company like this, all of these complaints would have made corporate management step in and make the necessary changes. A lot of corporate chains have stipulations where corporate HQ will fine the franchise owner, or if bad enough, force them out of the company. \nCORPORATE, if you are reading this, I would advise you to step in and fix this location.

Mind you, this has not happened since and was over a year ago.\nBut now, every time I have come, they don't have the syrups for and make it wrong, or, don't even know what the drink is even though it's on the website. I know that it gets backed up, having a drive thru and everything because I used to work in fast food. But it's just depressing to pay $6 and watch your drink get made wrong 3 times. They gave me what was basically a mocha frappucchino (the drink I ordered didn't have mocha in it!). I finally just took it because I had somewhere to be.","address":"830 W Warner Rd, Suite 104","attributes":{"BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","WiFi":"u'free'","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","RestaurantsTableService":"False","BikeParking":"True","HasTV":"False","RestaurantsReservations":"False","Caters":"False","GoodForKids":"True","Ambience":"{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","OutdoorSeating":"True","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","Alcohol":"u'none'","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","NoiseLevel":"'average'"},"categories":"Food, Restaurants, Coffee & Tea, Sandwiches, Salad","city":"Gilbert","hours":{"Monday":"4:0-21:30","Tuesday":"4:0-21:30","Wednesday":"4:0-21:30","Thursday":"4:0-21:30","Friday":"4:30-21:30","Saturday":"4:30-21:0","Sunday":"4:0-21:30"},"is_open":1,"latitude":33.335922,"longitude":-111.807546,"name":"Starbucks","postal_code":"85233","review_count":37,"Overall_Rating":3.0,"state":"AZ"},{"business_id":"lFaRO6kiCxa9VbYOuhMU9w","date":"2018-08-25T00:00:00.000Z","User_Rating":2,"text":"Went in on 8\/25\/18 ordered a grande iced caramel macchiato.

I used to go to this location when it was further back in this plaza, on the end next to the Mexican chain eatery (whose name escapes me at the moment). I loved that location, knew everyone in there, the regulars, the baristas were the best - nice, personable, everyone knew everyone and it was a real neighborhood place with comfortable seating, a really nice pleasant environment. Then they moved it to the front of this plaza, right on the corner to enable a drive through (this was done to the Starbucks that was at Gilbert Rd and Baseline, too). Both of these upgrades unfortunately resulted in less comfortable, less pleasant, less hospitable experiences going inside into the Starbucks. Yeah, I get it, Starbucks does way more business in the drive-thru and that's clearly their main concern. But for those of us looking for a place to sit down, enjoy conversation or do work on our laptops and use the internet, it totally sucks. Whoever designed these two new locations' interiors did a terrible job on creating a nice place to come into and sit down. The environments at both of them are just unpleasant; there's no comfortable chairs like they used to have, and something about the places is just cold, sterile, totally unappealing to come in, relax, talk or even work on a laptop. If they just wanted people to come in, buy coffee and leave, and that was their modus operandi, then they've succeeded. This location on Warner and Stapley was by far the nicest Starbrucks in the whole area (for miles and miles) to sit and relax and enjoy some company with the regulars. It was just a great spot: 4 comfy chairs all together to relax in with friends or just talk to other regulars. And now? No comfortable seating, no ambiance, just a very sterile, impersonal, not very appealing, indoor space. The baristas seem new and just don't seem comfortable in there either. Sucks all around. The one star is aimed at Starbucks corporate who took a great Starbucks and made it a totally unappealing, sterile environment to be in (the outside patio, in decent weather, being the sole part of it that's ok), either because the new designer sucks or they did this for more profit at the drive-thru and to keep it physically not conducive to patrons staying a while and hanging out (it's the same with the new Gilbert and Baseline location - super uninviting inside that one too). Needless to say, I've moved on and gone elsewhere. I just can't bring myself to go back to these locations \"post-op\".","address":"830 W Warner Rd, Suite 104","attributes":{"BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","WiFi":"u'free'","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","RestaurantsTableService":"False","BikeParking":"True","HasTV":"False","RestaurantsReservations":"False","Caters":"False","GoodForKids":"True","Ambience":"{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","OutdoorSeating":"True","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","Alcohol":"u'none'","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","NoiseLevel":"'average'"},"categories":"Food, Restaurants, Coffee & Tea, Sandwiches, Salad","city":"Gilbert","hours":{"Monday":"4:0-21:30","Tuesday":"4:0-21:30","Wednesday":"4:0-21:30","Thursday":"4:0-21:30","Friday":"4:30-21:30","Saturday":"4:30-21:0","Sunday":"4:0-21:30"},"is_open":1,"latitude":33.335922,"longitude":-111.807546,"name":"Starbucks","postal_code":"85233","review_count":37,"Overall_Rating":3.0,"state":"AZ"},{"business_id":"lFaRO6kiCxa9VbYOuhMU9w","date":"2018-01-13T00:00:00.000Z","User_Rating":4,"text":"Great smiles and greetings from the staff they offered new drink and I thought it to be just what I was looking for I would have given them 5 stars but for whatever reason it just doesn't seem open enough to comfortably hang and chill as I was hoping they would being a newer model and store .","address":"830 W Warner Rd, Suite 104","attributes":{"BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","WiFi":"u'free'","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","RestaurantsTableService":"False","BikeParking":"True","HasTV":"False","RestaurantsReservations":"False","Caters":"False","GoodForKids":"True","Ambience":"{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","OutdoorSeating":"True","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","Alcohol":"u'none'","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","NoiseLevel":"'average'"},"categories":"Food, Restaurants, Coffee & Tea, Sandwiches, Salad","city":"Gilbert","hours":{"Monday":"4:0-21:30","Tuesday":"4:0-21:30","Wednesday":"4:0-21:30","Thursday":"4:0-21:30","Friday":"4:30-21:30","Saturday":"4:30-21:0","Sunday":"4:0-21:30"},"is_open":1,"latitude":33.335922,"longitude":-111.807546,"name":"Starbucks","postal_code":"85233","review_count":37,"Overall_Rating":3.0,"state":"AZ"},{"business_id":"lFaRO6kiCxa9VbYOuhMU9w","date":"2017-10-16T00:00:00.000Z","User_Rating":1,"text":"Horrible experience, first I was rudely told by the woman in the drive thru that she couldnt hear me.

When I got to him I laid him in cash. He said he had no change and was going to pay me in $10 worth of quarters. I told him that was not ok and he needed to get me cash, no coins. He left the window, cane back and said the quarters were all he had. I said I wouldn't leave where I was without cash. He then produced two five dollar bills almost immediately. I'm still so confused by the whole transaction. I've never been handed $10 worth of quarters for change in my life. He next gave me my food and drinks.

I saw all of the past reviews and understood the reason for the low ratings.  My family and I were at the Verizon Wireless across the other side of the large parking lot; after 3+ hours of waiting in there, and we were STARVING.  Right across from this location is a Chic-Fil-A that we love but their parking area was full and the drive-thru line was long.  We saw this huge sign on this McDonald's \"Grand Opening\" and there were no more than two cars parked in their parking.  I remember reading the reviews but I knew the kids were starving and we all needed to use the restrooms as well.  So we crossed our fingers.... \n\nI don't know what it was, maybe it's because they felt changed, upgraded, or new but the staff was amazing!  Every single person actually seemed happy to be there.  They greeted us, took our order and we were handed over a pager.  (Guess it's better than yelling your name)  The restrooms were locked so when I asked for the \"key\" they pushed a button from the side wall and was advised it was unlocked and I could go ahead.  The ladies restroom was small but very clean.  Unfortunately, no paper towels to dry my hands with and so I had to grab the handle to open the door.  \n\nThe entire place was clean.  The soda fountain\/ketchup area was very clean and in order.  Not a single dirty table or food anywhere on the floor.  The place is divided in half... the area with more tables and open seats (quiet area) and then the play area with more space between tables for parents\/families.  They had comfortable chairs for the wheelchair accessible tables too.   \n\nIf you've been here before... give it another chance.  Yes, it's just fast-food.  There WILL be children but if you dine-in, there's plenty of comfortable seats away from the playground area.  We noticed that they had a lot of young children BY-THEMSELVES with no parents and no supervision around.  There was also a few homeless guests that stopped in but they were taken care of the same and they weren't bothering anyone.  I have nothing negative to say about this McDonald's.  We were hungry and our food looked and tasted good.  No soggy fries or over fried nuggets that have been sitting in old cooking oil - none of that.  \n\nAs I was taking pictures to share on Yelp... (I was spotted with my phone - lol)  a manager came up to me concerned, asking me if something was wrong.  I advised him that everything was fine.  He was actively involved assisting in the drive-thru as he was with the front registers.","address":"1635 E Camelback Rd","attributes":{"BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'","RestaurantsReservations":"False","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","HasTV":"False","GoodForKids":"True","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","OutdoorSeating":"False","Alcohol":"u'none'","NoiseLevel":"u'loud'","Ambience":"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': True}","DriveThru":"True","RestaurantsTableService":"False","Caters":"False","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': True, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': True}","BikeParking":"False","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","WiFi":"'free'"},"categories":"Restaurants, Fast Food, Burgers, Food, Coffee & Tea","city":"Phoenix","hours":{"Monday":"5:0-23:0","Tuesday":"5:0-23:0","Wednesday":"5:0-23:0","Thursday":"5:0-23:0","Friday":"5:0-1:0","Saturday":"5:0-1:0","Sunday":"5:0-23:0"},"is_open":1,"latitude":33.5087254154,"longitude":-112.0461962326,"name":"McDonald's","postal_code":"85016","review_count":41,"Overall_Rating":2.5,"state":"AZ"},{"business_id":"iPa__LOhse-hobC2Xmp-Kw","date":"2016-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","User_Rating":2,"text":"I guess I shouldn't expect much from McDonald's.

I don't eat @ McDonald's or other fast food establishments.  Usually if I did, it's because i was being cute using their free coupons or special promos (birthdays, anniversaries,...).\nYesterday around 1 PM, I decided to stop by since I was in the neighborhood to redeem their free coupons that I received in the (junk) mail, for free small fries and a fruit smoothie.  I selected strawberry-flavored smoothie for a 'drink' to wash down the fries.  I was served by cashier Daniel, who was very polite and timely, and he even thought it was cute that I had the free coupons ;)  He accepted 2 separate coupons, and I was not charged sales tax so I didn't have to pull change out of my wallet.  How courteous.  I dined in, partly so I could take a photo in that setting for you Yelpers ;)  I sat at a cool polished 'wood' counter with a comfy leather stool, cozily inside the one area that looked like it's for WifFi users (not sure if you could use a laptop at that very area as I didn't bring mine). \nThe fries were hot and tasty with not too much salt, and the smoothie had the right texture and wasn't too much like softened ice cream and wasn't too cold and did taste like strawberry.  Oh, when I asked another server next to Daniel if there was a fork, she handed me fork & knife that were encased in factory-sealed plastic wrap.  She also hinted that there were a straw and self-service ketchup at a station behind me.  It was just fairly busy and the staff kept up with that pace as if they were properly trained for their positions.  Even the rest of the people picking up or dining in were polite.  As I was waiting for my order (for about 5 minutes, a woman came up to Daniel and mentioned something wrong with her hamburger (like missing the onions), he quickly accompanied her without treating her like an anal hassle.  I also noticed that the establishment appeared to have been renovated, and it was clean and very modern, and the ambiance was casual and room temperature was at a comfortable level..\nOverall, it was a professional service for that type of establishment, and I left pleased.

But once I dug deeper into the bowl, the lettuce was brown and old. I've ordered chicken nuggets and fries a few times and some times they were hot and other times they weren't. And don't get me started on the actual employees. Not friendly, no smiles on their face and probably a few cases of badly drawn eyebrows. Lesson learned, will not be coming back even if it's for the delicious frosty.","address":"1725 W Charleston Blvd","attributes":{"BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"False","HasTV":"False","Alcohol":"u'none'","Ambience":"{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","WiFi":"u'no'","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","BikeParking":"True","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","RestaurantsAttire":"u'casual'","GoodForKids":"True","OutdoorSeating":"False","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"},"categories":"Restaurants, Burgers, Fast Food","city":"Las Vegas","hours":{"Monday":"9:0-1:0","Tuesday":"9:0-1:0","Wednesday":"9:0-1:0","Thursday":"9:0-1:0","Friday":"9:0-1:0","Saturday":"9:0-1:0","Sunday":"9:0-1:0"},"is_open":1,"latitude":36.1585672,"longitude":-115.1648998,"name":"Wendy's","postal_code":"89102","review_count":31,"Overall_Rating":2.5,"state":"NV"},{"business_id":"uaBVv3tZJaOd8lfPFInzTA","date":"2018-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","User_Rating":4,"text":"My new fav!

I visited the previous, and celebrated the grand re-opening. A quick pros\/cons list:\n\nI greatly appreciate the expanded and healthy menu options. When I do visit, it's for a grilled chicken sandwich, a wrap, or a salad with grilled chicken. Quick and healthy. Maybe a Frosty to take the edge off. I like to use the phone app, sometimes to pre-order, and always to check mega discounts and freebies. There is much value to be found here. Service has been friendly, and the new interior is kept clean and bright. I like. \n\nAs others have mentioned, there is often a delay in service, however. This Wendy's hasn't quite figured yet how to put the fast in fast-food, so while we could all benefit from learning to slow down a bit, sometimes haste is in order. Nowhere else is that more true than in a fast-food joint.

I thought it was maybe isolated to the entrance area, but no. The entire store smelled awful. The employee taking our order was talking in goofy voices and accents and laughing as if it were funny, interrupting us while we tried to tell him our order. My boyfriend waited for the two coffees we ordered while I went to the restroom, which was even worse. There was trash all over the floor, a scum like substance on the wall, and it smelled even worse than the rest of the store. When I returned back to the front of the store, the coffees still were not ready. We ordered two iced coffees, each with almond milk. Nothing complicated. We continued to stand and wait while two employees socialized, the employee taking orders kept goofing off, a worker near the back room screamed at someone on the phone, and someone in a yellow t-shirt and jeans made himself coffee behind the counter. After a while, the mysterious man in a yellow shirt that did not in the slightest resemble an employee asked what we were waiting on. He then told one of the socializing girls who proceeded to get our half made drinks that were sitting on the back counter the whole time. She then poured milk that was sitting on the counter into both coffees. In fact, all of the milks were sitting out. Without lids. And there were crumbs and food all over the counters.

I know it's not their fault that they're out, it's corporate's fault, but a little smile and some hot water without attitude doesn't seem too much to ask for.","address":"7170 N.

I like the remodeling that they have done to this location. Service has always been great for me. The thing that is that the drinks are inconsistent. I only ever get one drink - iced caramel macchiato. And sometimes there's barely any caramel at all.  For a drink that had \"caramel\" in the title, it should definitely taste like it. Sometimes my drink tastes mostly like milk, and sometimes the espresso is overwhelming. Bacon gouda sandwiches (although frozen) are so good!

Before he could respond, the lady in the back insisted that Starbucks doesn't make that drink in the US and that it's only available in Japan, and proceeds to tell me that she's worked at Starbucks for 4 years and knows more than I do, even though I've personally ordered the drink several times, both during the spring promotion back in March and after the promotion was over (as a custom drink). She kept insisting that they can't make it, and even as I tried to suggest to her how the drink is made, she responded with \"that hardly sounds like a Cherry Blossom Frap\", which is comical because for someone who has never made that drink (since apparently it's only available in Japan), she suddenly knows exactly how it's made?! \nI then opened up the Starbucks promotion announcement of the drink, directly from the Starbucks website, and read it aloud to her, recipe and all, to which she replied \"oh... that drink\". And even then she still gave me a hard time, saying how they're out of this ingredient and that sauce, and that it's not gonna taste the same. I said that's fine, so she proceeded to tell the guy taking my order how to make the drink. They were too busy arguing with me about the drink that they didn't even bother to ask me about the size, so they rung me up for a grande when I wanted a venti. When I saw her making the drink with a grande cup, I told her that I wanted a venti, and AGAIN she gave me a hard time about it, saying that the other guy rung me up for a grande, and even pointed at the label on the cup, and because of that she can't change it. I reminded her that I paid for the drink with a free drink reward so it doesn't matter what the size is, and she quickly changed her tone and asked if I wanted a venti instead (obviously?). I watched her like a hawk while she was making the drink to make sure she didn't do anything funny, and she knew it too - every time she turned around and saw me looking at her she got super nervous. She handed me the drink without a single apology, thank you, or greeting of any kind. \n\nUnfortunately I didn't get her name, but every time I've been to this location they've either given me a hard time because of my order, given me a bad attitude, screwed up my drink, or all of the above. Not to mention, the tables are always sticky and the floors are always full of trash. Not sure what is going on with the management here, but I've made it a point not to come back to this location anymore.","address":"7170 N.

One employee was literally yelling and the others just laughed. No one ever said hey dude keep it down there's a customer in the store, they all just fed into his immature nonsense. The worst part of all of this is there was a supervisor in the store because I heard him saying to the other employees \"hey don't talk to me like that I'm your supervisor!\" Yet he could not manage the conduct of his employees while a customer was in the store.

The girls up front were having their own loud conversation and not paying attention to the people taking their orders. When one girl asked me what I wanted, I told her, and instead of finishing it, she loaded the bowl with sour cream and left. The second girl who came to pick up on my order proceeded to drench my bowl with more sour cream, and when she saw what she had done, she just covered it with the remaining stuff. She then did not listen to what I asked for on my two burritos, and added whatever she thought was correct. The girl at the register charged me for an extra quesadilla and was more concerned with carrying out the conversation with the other girls up front. Also, another girl swiped rice that was scattered all over the counter back into the tray of rice. Very unsanitary.

The food taste just like any other chipotle and the portions are well the same so no argument there.  \n\nThe 2 star review comes down to the line constantly being out the door and the staff not able to move it quickly like other chipotles.  I understand there is a lunch and dinner time rush but this has never effected any other chipotle I've been to.  \n\nMy least favorite part of this location and the main reason for the low review is the online ordering.  While the app is very easy to use and says exactly what you want on the order and even on the receipt here I am yet again with another messed up order that I just picked up.  If this were the first time I could get over it however I have NEVER, and that is a true fact, never received a correct online order that is spelled out on the receipt in front of them.  My daughter ordered a chicken quesadilla kids mean with white rice and pinto beans like always.  We paid the extra for the chicken.  And we have no chicken and one scoop of rice for a kids meal.

I asked for 2 burrito bowls, easy enough right? Nooope. They were out of fajita veggies, barbacoa, sour cream, guacamole and chips! They gave me very little rice and meat and when I asked for a little more they said they were going to have to double charge me. And the line was incredibly dirty there was a white film all over the counter and they were throwing food around so fast and sloppily that cheese got into one of the bowls and in my salsa. I'm allergic to dairy so I ended up not being able to use salsa on my bowl. I ended up having to wait 15 minutes for chips to come out and by the time I got the chips and got home, my food was cold and had to be reheated. Won't be going back to this location.

I get a salted caramel frap every time. No special requests, so they should be able to execute it perfectly. I went the first time when they first opened in 2017. It was all ice, almost no flavor and very little liquid. I gave them a few months and tried again thinking they just needed to get into their groove. Same! All ice, no liquid, little flavor. I tried again this morning probably 6 months after my 2nd attempt and SAME. All ice and no flavor!! I know they would say if you don't like it you can ask them to remake it. But as a mom I'm trying to juggle my belongings and a child. I don't critique my drink until I'm in the car and driving away. Also, for a $6 drink they should know how to make, I feel I should be able to trust it's made right. \n\nNeedless to say, 3 strikes and I will not be returning to this Starbucks again.","address":"17002 N.

I own a local business in the same area and in the past few years have averaged $300-$500 a month in online food orders for my employees and I. This year I stopped ordering and coming to this establishment because the quality of service consistently declined. More often than not every time we ordered lunch online and came to pick up the order, it was not ready or made incorrectly. My employees or I would come to pick up the order at the listed time of completion on the website and come to find out the order had not even got processed. Many times the store was not even busy, and employees where just standing around. So today I decided to try and order again online, entered my order in at 2:45 pm, came to pick it up at 3:45, and the same issue with the food not being ready had occurred again (there was only one customer in line) In one hour a simple online order could not be processed!! I had to wait another 10 minutes for them to make the food. I spoke to the manager and she had no answer to why this problem keeps occurring after I told her this continuously happens when we order online. She offered me a refund, and I declined it, I do not care for the money, I just wanted a realistic answer to why the online ordering service is so poor when a year or two ago this problem never was a issue.","address":"2546 E Craig Rd, Ste 100","attributes":{"BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","Caters":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","HasTV":"False","GoodForKids":"True","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","DriveThru":"False","OutdoorSeating":"True","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","RestaurantsAttire":"u'casual'","Alcohol":"u'beer_and_wine'","WiFi":"u'no'","BikeParking":"True","Ambience":"{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"False","NoiseLevel":"u'average'","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1"},"categories":"Restaurants, Fast Food, Mexican","city":"North Las Vegas","hours":{"Monday":"10:45-22:0","Tuesday":"10:45-22:0","Wednesday":"10:45-22:0","Thursday":"10:45-22:0","Friday":"10:45-22:0","Saturday":"10:45-22:0","Sunday":"10:45-22:0"},"is_open":1,"latitude":36.2402631028,"longitude":-115.1161852658,"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","postal_code":"89030","review_count":112,"Overall_Rating":3.0,"state":"NV"},{"business_id":"-YBC5pR2eW0C2sPygH25MA","date":"2017-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","User_Rating":5,"text":"Frequent this location often and never have an issue. \nThe service is fast, food is hot and people are friendly. \nI miss the military discount tho!

When I got there I was surprised to see at least 10 to 15 people having lunch, to me this is a good sign because it means the franchise is finally overcoming all the negative publicity regarding their food.\n\nI decided to go ahead and try the barbacoa burrito. The area where they have their cooked meats and greens was very clean and looked organized. The greens looked very fresh and the meat looked as if they were in fact keeping a fresh batch.\n\nMy Barbacoa burrito had the barbacoa black beans, white rice, pico de gallo sour cream, avocado, and green salsa.\n\nLike I mentioned before I was a little skeptical and not too sure of what I was getting myself into by eating the food but I have to say to my surprise this burrito was very delicious. All the ingredients we're fresh cooked just right,and the burrito it self was very filling. The Barbacoa was actually  really good and it tasted  like actual barbacoa  not too many spices, not over seasoned,  it was done just right . The cost of the burrito with all the extras added to it was roughly $9 not a bad deal for the quality of food that they are now serving,and the amount of food you get stuffed into your burrito.\n\nOverall not a bad experience I'm glad I gave it a second chance the food tasted good, good service, clean place, I was really impressed as to how far Chipotle has come and with this being said it looks like I might give it another chance in the near future.","address":"2546 E Craig Rd, Ste 100","attributes":{"BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","Caters":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","HasTV":"False","GoodForKids":"True","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","DriveThru":"False","OutdoorSeating":"True","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","RestaurantsAttire":"u'casual'","Alcohol":"u'beer_and_wine'","WiFi":"u'no'","BikeParking":"True","Ambience":"{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"False","NoiseLevel":"u'average'","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1"},"categories":"Restaurants, Fast Food, Mexican","city":"North Las Vegas","hours":{"Monday":"10:45-22:0","Tuesday":"10:45-22:0","Wednesday":"10:45-22:0","Thursday":"10:45-22:0","Friday":"10:45-22:0","Saturday":"10:45-22:0","Sunday":"10:45-22:0"},"is_open":1,"latitude":36.2402631028,"longitude":-115.1161852658,"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","postal_code":"89030","review_count":112,"Overall_Rating":3.0,"state":"NV"},{"business_id":"-YBC5pR2eW0C2sPygH25MA","date":"2017-10-20T00:00:00.000Z","User_Rating":4,"text":"This Chipotle does well based on the location to Nellis and I-15.

The person after me got their burgers first and also had a huge mix up with their order aswell. \n\nI really didn't see how they can get so confused over nothing but whatever.","address":"3088 Highway 7","attributes":{"RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"False","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","GoodForKids":"True","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","Ambience":"{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","Alcohol":"'none'","OutdoorSeating":"True","HasTV":"False","Caters":"False","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","BikeParking":"True","WiFi":"'no'","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': True, 'breakfast': False}"},"categories":"Restaurants, Burgers, Fast Food","city":"Markham","hours":{"Monday":"7:0-1:0","Tuesday":"7:0-1:0","Wednesday":"7:0-1:0","Thursday":"7:0-1:0","Friday":"7:0-3:0","Saturday":"7:0-3:0","Sunday":"7:0-1:0"},"is_open":1,"latitude":43.8508179706,"longitude":-79.3551841965,"name":"Burger King","postal_code":"L3R 0J4","review_count":18,"Overall_Rating":2.0,"state":"ON"},{"business_id":"he_aQrSoqOUTBVEe8yPkQw","date":"2018-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","User_Rating":1,"text":"1 star, that's all i will give them.

One of the kids got hit in the face and there was blood everywhere. None of the staff came to offer any help, just customers. It took forever for the \"manager\" to come out and say they were closing the play area. It took 10 minutes and nobody was even leaving!?!

I usually love going to Starbucks because of the environment and friendly customer service. However, tonight was not the case! My friend and I were the only ones in line and we didn't get greeted or acknowledged.  It was around 7:30 PM! It's not like they were closing soon or going through a huge rush or anything like that. The barista behind the counter actually left on a bathroom break as we were at the counter ready to order & the other girl wasn't any help at all. By the time the guy came back, he didn't say anything to us or come back to the register to take our order! In fact, his back was turned away from us and we were just standing there waiting. I don't expect perfection, but as a customer ready to pay nearly $6 and then some for a drink, I DO expect AT LEAST an acknowledgment. If he was occupied with something else, he didn't even have the audacity to say \"I'll be right with you ladies\" or \"Thanks for waiting. I'll be with right with you shortly\" or anything of that manner. Totally unprofessional! Amidst leaving to go the bathroom while we were at the register ready to order, the other girl working & yet not helping us at all, and no one seemingly enough ready and wanting to take our order, my friend and I walked out of the establishment and will never return to this location.

What I will mention about this particular location is that the staff are always fairly friendly and it seems there's always a line out the door.

It's a very neighborly, friendly vibe and I love it. My one, constructive observation is that the service is insanely S-L-O-W, especially on a weekend morning. Today I waited nearly 20-25 minutes for my venti Latte and oatmeal. As I live in the area, I know that this was not just a one-off occurrence, but that it seems to be the norm. I really think this is unacceptable for a Starbucks. I think there's an opportunity to streamline the service so that the patrons can be moved in and out fairly quickly.

Why I don't know.  In years past I used to like Subway and ate there several times a week.  The only reason I go to this one is because where I live I have a choice between the raw cook it yourself pizza place (that I stopped going to) and Subway.  I simply don't have any other nearby fast food options when I've had a long day and want a fast bite to eat.\n\nAfter my most recent visit I was prompted to write this review because I wondered why it looked like there was so little meat on my salad, which after all is just supposed to be a sandwich without bread, right?  Being naturally curious I had to find the answer to that question and I did, directly from a Subway franchise owner (not the one who owns this store however).\n\nIt seems their \"formula\" is that if you order a sandwich as a salad it is built to have a six inch portion of meat and cheese and a footlong's portion of veggies.\n\nBut the rub comes when you pay for it.  If you order that meal as a SMALL sandwich it will cost you $4.59 and if you order that same sandwich as a LARGE it will cost you $4.99.  Now if you follow their formula and get a large amount of veggies and a small amount of meat and cheese how much do you think it will cost you?  Wrong!  The salad version is $6.58!!!  That is some creative math they've got going on there.\n\nThat would be bad enough but, hey it's my choice to be stupid and not just buy a large loaded sandwich and throw the bread away.  My reason for giving them 0-stars however (and calling in the Dept of Weights and Measures) is look at the picture of my salad.  Do you think that's the same amount of meat that they put on a small sub sandwich?  I doubt it. \n\nBut look again. See anything missing?  Yep, NO CHEESE!!\n\nSo now the question is should we call it creative math or something far more sinister like the fact that they got busted because their \"footlong\" sandwiches weren't actually 12\" long?  Stay tuned.  Maybe that location will be vacant soon and I'll have a whole new option for fast food near my house.","address":"3230 E Union Hills Dr, Ste B-125, Union Centre Shoppes","attributes":{"GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"False","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","DriveThru":"False","OutdoorSeating":"False","Alcohol":"'none'","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","GoodForKids":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","HasTV":"False","WiFi":"'no'","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","Ambience":"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': False}","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'"},"categories":"Restaurants, Sandwiches, Fast Food","city":"Phoenix","hours":{"Monday":"7:0-22:0","Tuesday":"7:0-22:0","Wednesday":"7:0-22:0","Thursday":"7:0-22:0","Friday":"7:0-22:0","Saturday":"8:0-21:0","Sunday":"9:0-21:0"},"is_open":1,"latitude":33.6556530143,"longitude":-112.0120320842,"name":"Subway","postal_code":"85050","review_count":9,"Overall_Rating":3.0,"state":"AZ"},{"business_id":"3w66rzZq_rjA1kSmVt5Hew","date":"2018-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","User_Rating":3,"text":"When you are thinking about the slogan \" always fresh\" you think you will get fresh \nEverytime I want to eat and I can't find something good I go to subway bc it's easy and fast , but I don't know why everytime after I'm done I'm asking my self why did I go there \nThe good thing is that they have so many option \nThe bad thing that it's all not the best food \nThe team is nice and friendly \nThe place is clean and working fast","address":"3230 E Union Hills Dr, Ste B-125, Union Centre Shoppes","attributes":{"GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"False","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","DriveThru":"False","OutdoorSeating":"False","Alcohol":"'none'","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","GoodForKids":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","HasTV":"False","WiFi":"'no'","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","Ambience":"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': False}","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'"},"categories":"Restaurants, Sandwiches, Fast Food","city":"Phoenix","hours":{"Monday":"7:0-22:0","Tuesday":"7:0-22:0","Wednesday":"7:0-22:0","Thursday":"7:0-22:0","Friday":"7:0-22:0","Saturday":"8:0-21:0","Sunday":"9:0-21:0"},"is_open":1,"latitude":33.6556530143,"longitude":-112.0120320842,"name":"Subway","postal_code":"85050","review_count":9,"Overall_Rating":3.0,"state":"AZ"},{"business_id":"3w66rzZq_rjA1kSmVt5Hew","date":"2018-08-31T00:00:00.000Z","User_Rating":4,"text":"First time going to this location.

The gurl didnt punch in my order right. She punched it in as \n                           6 piece\n                          apple pie\n\nEveryone knows when u order a combo from mc Donald it will state everything that comes in the combo inculding the drink. like this e.g \n                   6 piece combo\n                        M fries \n              Drink: strwbry frutopia \n                  Sweet nd sour\n                      Apple pie\n\nIt didn't say nun of that. It said \n                     6 piece \n                    Apple pie\n\nSo I repeated my order to make sure she knew that I wanted the combo. She still never asked me what kinda of drink so i told her, she punched it in and charger me for it but I still never seen no medium fries so i repeated my order again 3rd time. so she knew i wanted the COMBO and not jus a 6 peice with a drink and Apple pie She finally got it right with help And every thing came on the screen correctly. so good ( someone came to help ) \n\nBUT THEN!!!! They didnt turn off their MIC and i her another gurl said. \"Dont giver her any napkins she bright\" in other words \"dont giver her any napkins shes rude* \"bright\" is a Jamaican slang for \"rude\"  so i thought that she thought becuz i was making sure my oder was right i was being rude. I cudnt believe wat I herd so i said \"dont give who any napkins\" they realized i herd, didnt respond and shut the mic off \n\nRemind u der was other ppl in the drive thru and I'm sure ppl inside im not sure who the gurl was talking about when she said that but hearing that alone, becuz they FORGOT TO TURN off their mic. Made me not even want my food or to go back here ever again. Becuz imagine wats said or done to ur food or oder wen its complicated or u correct them on it and they turn off the mic\n\n\nI was so mad about this I went in to notify the manager and she didn't seem to care or take action. All doe she remained calm it also helps to show some companion and take action into the customers complaint and show that something is being done. Or someone is being held accountable for this. Or some kind of action she was jus standing their staring at me saying \"it's ok\" but didn't do anything or go ask anyone for info  I asked her who said that she said \" I can't tell you\" I said \"why\" she said \"becuz i can't\" so that means she herd wat was said It seems like she is scared of her crew or is friends with them and cudnt control them due to the fact that they have so much attitude. She then said to me shes gonna handle it and that I shud leave. I told her I will never order from this place again I will contact the boss about wat I herd over the mic I had work so i left. IM DISGUSTEDD!!! DIDNT EVEN WANT MY FOOD ANYMORE becuz I was scared that maybe they did something to it. If she cud say dont give a customer napkins becuz he or she is being rude I wonder wat else shes done  I will be contacting the owner to notify him about this. his number is on the door ironically so u can share ur experiance with him . Maybe he can take some action into having better staff becuz the crew memeber that said that and a customer hearing that can cause customer to turn away.   But i dont believe everyone shud be held accountable for one persons comment becuz she was the only one that said that. The person who was trying to take my order wasn't rude she jus didnt know how to punch In  but these ppl r handling r food  so that one person shud be held accoubtable. u never know wat they do to ur order when it's complicated or they get frustrated Imagine if my order was reallly complicated that same gurl probaly wud have spat in my food","address":"150 Rimrock Road","attributes":{"RestaurantsAttire":"u'casual'","OutdoorSeating":"False","BikeParking":"False","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","HasTV":"False","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","Ambience":"{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","GoodForKids":"True","Alcohol":"u'none'","RestaurantsReservations":"False"},"categories":"Restaurants, Burgers, Fast Food","city":"Toronto","hours":{"Monday":"0:0-0:0","Tuesday":"0:0-0:0","Wednesday":"0:0-0:0","Thursday":"0:0-0:0","Friday":"0:0-0:0","Saturday":"0:0-0:0","Sunday":"0:0-0:0"},"is_open":1,"latitude":43.7580323,"longitude":-79.465378,"name":"McDonald's","postal_code":"M3J 3A6","review_count":11,"Overall_Rating":3.0,"state":"ON"},{"business_id":"93HQMacPKmVVRLd8Oebx5w","date":"2016-01-21T00:00:00.000Z","User_Rating":4,"text":"This one is okay.

We went through the drive-thru and were greeted by a female employee who, at first, seemed professional and friendly.  I was driving the car and after her greeting us and asking what we would like, I politely (and I'm especially polite at fast food restaurants out of fear of food sabotage!) asked her to give us a minute to look over the menu.  She very nicely said that was fine and instructed me to order when I was ready.  So far, so good.  \n\nNo less than 30 seconds later, she got back on the speaker and curtly said, \"Are you ready yet or what?\"  I'm not sure what could possibly have happened in the half minute since she last spoke to us but her demeanor had changed drastically.  I wasn't really ready but again, in an effort not to piss off someone who's making my food in a sight unseen kitchen, I obliged and started to place our order.  She interrupted me probably 2 or 3 times while saying my order; it was just so rude.  I'm well aware that I need to indicate what size value meal I want and what kind of drink I want - no need to continually interrupt me while I'm speaking to ask me.  Wait until I'm done talking and if I haven't told you exactly what I want, then feel free to ask away.  But to interrupt me over and over again?  Hello?  Common sense and courtesy, anyone?  Both are highly lacking here.  \n\nI pulled around to the window and gave my money to a gentleman who was nice but not overly friendly.  Not a big deal.  However, when the woman who was obviously the gem on the drive thru speaker (I say obvious because she was the only one there with a headset on) came to the window, she literally handed me the bag of food, did not look me in the eye a single time and started to close the window.  Not a word was spoken.  No thank you.  No enjpy your food.  No come back again.  Nothing.  I wondered if she had suddenly become a mute.  I said thank you as she was handing me the bag and she literally kept looking over my car and out into the street. Annoyed at this point, as she closed the window I yelled out to her, \"Hello?  I said thank you!\" She looked at me with a blank stare and walked away.  Again, not a word was spoken by her.  \n\nUnfortunately, the food didn't redeem the horrible customer service.  The fries were obviously old and the tortilla on my grilled chicken wrap was so hard around the edges that I ended up just taking everything out of it and eating it like a salad (which, to be honest, wasn't that bad but I wanted a wrap, dammit!).  My husband did enjoy his burger but his fries were old, too.  \n\nLook - I get that eating at a fast food joint is hit and miss and I understand that going late at night can get even sketchier but there's just no justification for an employee acting like that and most definitely no excuse for the food to be old and hard.  If you're open until midnight or 1am, I should be able to get food that late that's as fresh as it is if I come at the dinner rush.  I'm sympathetic to fast food employees - it's a thankless job, they're not paid well and I'm quite certain that a lot of their customers (especially in this shady area of town) are real pains in the ass.  \n\nWith that being said, like I mentioned before, I am NOT a pain the ass when ordering food at any restaurant establishment, and most definitely not if I'm ordering at the drive through of a fast food place.  If I'm being rude and condescending, by all means - dish it back out to me! I don't expect to be treated well if I'm not treating you well.  But if I'm nice, friendly and respectful, is it too much to ask for the same?  \n\nAnd now I'll close - with this being the longest Yelp review I've ever placed.  Whew!  I'm coming up for air and if you've made it all the way to the end of this, I salute you!","address":"990 N Nellis Blvd","attributes":{"Alcohol":"'none'","WiFi":"u'no'","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","RestaurantsReservations":"False","OutdoorSeating":"False","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","Ambience":"{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'classy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","BikeParking":"False","RestaurantsAttire":"u'casual'","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","Caters":"False","NoiseLevel":"u'loud'","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","GoodForKids":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","HasTV":"False"},"categories":"Restaurants, Fast Food, Burgers","city":"Las Vegas","hours":null,"is_open":1,"latitude":36.1774812,"longitude":-115.0616815,"name":"Wendy's","postal_code":"89110","review_count":24,"Overall_Rating":2.0,"state":"NV"},{"business_id":"bw_bCNXNBrgarlmrgURkoA","date":"2017-08-18T00:00:00.000Z","User_Rating":1,"text":"First I go to through the drive thru see A employee out side  smoking pull to the next window he walks in and get straight on the grill without washing his hands then the food they gave me the patties was raw in middle SMH","address":"990 N Nellis Blvd","attributes":{"Alcohol":"'none'","WiFi":"u'no'","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","RestaurantsReservations":"False","OutdoorSeating":"False","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","Ambience":"{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'classy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","BikeParking":"False","RestaurantsAttire":"u'casual'","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","Caters":"False","NoiseLevel":"u'loud'","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","GoodForKids":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","HasTV":"False"},"categories":"Restaurants, Fast Food, Burgers","city":"Las Vegas","hours":null,"is_open":1,"latitude":36.1774812,"longitude":-115.0616815,"name":"Wendy's","postal_code":"89110","review_count":24,"Overall_Rating":2.0,"state":"NV"},{"business_id":"bw_bCNXNBrgarlmrgURkoA","date":"2016-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","User_Rating":2,"text":"Great service but....COLD FRIES.

Tonight we ordered 2 meals a Big Mac meal and a Filet-o-fish meal.  The fish was a brick!  I have no idea how long it had been sitting prior to use but was completely inedible with barely any sauce.  The Big Mac tasted stale as if old bread had been used.  The fries were your typical re-heat and unsalted.  Anyone that enjoys McDonalds knows there is nothing worse than old fries.  I even questioned if they had given me a vanilla milkshake since it wasn't even mixed.  The only thing enjoyed about this meal was the Dr Pepper which was forgotten as part of the order and had to be asked for.  But I must say, the most entertaining of all was to open my Filet-o-fish box only to find a Big Mac inside and the fish sandwich in the Big Mac Box.  To think these fast food workers campaign for $15 an hour and for your hard earned money give you a meal you wouldn't even feed your dog.

I tried twice to explain to her that I could see my receipt in the slot but she just kept giving me the same respond.

What she meant was \"it's just a stupid receipt and stop asking us\". I already know it's not true because this happened before and I got one re printed. Frankly I really didn't care about the receipt, it's the general laziness of either of them walking back there to get the someone with a key bit that probably bothered me more. Never mind that legally they have to give a customer a receipt when asked. \n\nWhile I was waiting to speak with the manager, a customer walked up and said \"I ordered two sausage egg mcmuffins and these have neither sausage or egg in them\".

It is lovely. \n\nYes, it is still crowded; yes, it is still loud; yes, the lines will still be long. I now stand before you and say so what. Do what I do---STARBUCKS APP. Yep. I just put my order in while on the bus and by the time I walk down there BOOM it is made and I just take it and walk out. This app is amazing. After 12 drinks you then even start earning free food and drinks!! How is that not the best thing ever? \n\nOk. So the reason for the updated review is because of the Citrus Green Tea Latte. Picture this, a lovely lunch in Oakland is finished and I was asked if I would want some coffee. I am not the biggest coffee drinker but just thought, eh why not. The lines were short and since the person I was going with did not have the app I just went through the line like a \"regular Starbucks customer\" (;-) LOL.) The big sign hanging above the register spoke to me. Citrus Green Tea. YUM. I asked the staff member waiting on me his thoughts on the new bevvy. He said it was, \"very citrusy and refreshing\". My next question was about the sweetness. He assured me that it would not be overly sweet and I would enjoy it. Since I had a free drink coupon I thought, what the hell, I'll try it. \n\nI am honestly saying I am happy that I did. This is a seasonal beverage and I hope, AND PRAY. That they decide to keep it. It was refreshing and citrusy just like the staff told me. Basically, it was everything I have ever hoped for in a green tea citrus drink. \n\nI came back to the office and made four girls try it. Everyone loved it!!! (Good thing I got the biggest size!!!) I am looking forward to going back for more!

This one in particular was actually quite amazing as it has a CLOVER!  For all those who truly like good coffee, the clover is a programmable brewing system that takes in account everything... time, temp, pressure, and it's programmed at HQ for each specific bean.  They only use their reserve beans for Clover.  If there is ever a time to drink coffee black at Starbucks... this would be it.  \n\nThe service wasn't very fast but I dont blame the staff... they had at least 6 people at all times going at it.  The people who are not used to ordering at Starbucks was dragging down the wait time in a PAINFUL way.  I almost feel like they need a primer ... I digress.  \n\nThey do have several tables off to the side to enjoy your coffee.  It was quite packed during a random Sunday and I would say it's probably hard to snag the tables for 4.

When i took a sip the latte it was so sweet. Worst experience in all thr starbucks i have been too. I mean if i am paying that much for a drink i expect my drinks come out correctly and be treated with respect. I will report this joint to the starbuck head quarter.","address":"Pearson Airport Terminal 3, 6301 Silver Dart Drive","attributes":{"OutdoorSeating":"False","BikeParking":"False","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","Caters":"False","BusinessParking":"{'garage': True, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","WiFi":"'free'"},"categories":"Food, Coffee & Tea","city":"Mississauga","hours":{"Monday":"3:0-23:0","Tuesday":"3:0-23:0","Wednesday":"3:0-23:0","Thursday":"3:0-23:0","Friday":"3:0-23:0","Saturday":"3:0-23:0","Sunday":"3:0-23:0"},"is_open":1,"latitude":43.6854039551,"longitude":-79.6235204891,"name":"Starbucks","postal_code":"L4V 1E8","review_count":13,"Overall_Rating":2.0,"state":"ON"},{"business_id":"n8jmLxbnoOE6zE5TkNHNOQ","date":"2018-08-11T00:00:00.000Z","User_Rating":1,"text":"I literally just ordered 2 minutes ago and I had to write this review ASAP because this is the worst Starbucks i have ever been to. Save your money and do not buy from here. I would give this NEGATIVE stars if I could. \n\nI ordered an iced blooming rose tea latte and I overheard the staff talking about if the drink I ordered had any special requests and I think the younger barista was saying something about if the customer doesn't like the drink then *shrug*. I am not 100% sure what they were talking about because it was loud but it was something along the lines of what I had typed earlier. It was the fact that she a whole \"i dont care\" attitude when she was talking to the older lady. \nAnyway, I saw her shaking\/mixing the drink IN THE CUP with the lid... this made the lid dirty and i have never ever seen a Starbucks barista shake and mix the drink with the lid on. My best friend has worked at Starbucks for years and told me they dont do this. I usually like watching the baristas mix drinks so this was very unusual. In addition, the drink was not even mixed well. It was very powdery and you can see the powder sticking on the side of the cup. ALSO it was not filled up to the top. The younger barista tried to play it off by saying it was just the powder that makes it look not full(??).. are you kidding me? I have never received a Starbucks drink that wasn't filled up to the rim or close to the rim. This was an inch off of the rim. When she remade it, she did not use the cup to mix. Told you so. \n\nWhen i told her that it tasted powdery, she just took my drink and threw it away and said nothing to me and started remaking it. Talk about HORRIBLE customer service. How can you hire someone like this? Seriously. Okay, even if she was having a bad day, you could at least tell me youre going to say \"sorry about that. I'll remake your drink.\" I'm not even asking you to be friendly, just let me know. She literally just took it and threw it away. Absolutely unacceptable customer service. Don't give your customer attitude for something that you screwed up on. Doesn't make any fricking sense.\n\nEDIT: ordered light ice and they gave me regular ice. Tossed the drink next to the POS machine without any mention that it was my drink; they just nudged it towards me. Franchise owner needs to fire these employees and be updated about the terrible reviews on Yelp. None are good reviews. They dont deserve to continue working in customer service and if they continue to serve customers like the way they served me, Starbucks will be painted in a bad light.","address":"Pearson Airport Terminal 3, 6301 Silver Dart Drive","attributes":{"OutdoorSeating":"False","BikeParking":"False","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","Caters":"False","BusinessParking":"{'garage': True, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","WiFi":"'free'"},"categories":"Food, Coffee & Tea","city":"Mississauga","hours":{"Monday":"3:0-23:0","Tuesday":"3:0-23:0","Wednesday":"3:0-23:0","Thursday":"3:0-23:0","Friday":"3:0-23:0","Saturday":"3:0-23:0","Sunday":"3:0-23:0"},"is_open":1,"latitude":43.6854039551,"longitude":-79.6235204891,"name":"Starbucks","postal_code":"L4V 1E8","review_count":13,"Overall_Rating":2.0,"state":"ON"},{"business_id":"n8jmLxbnoOE6zE5TkNHNOQ","date":"2016-11-04T00:00:00.000Z","User_Rating":1,"text":"Worst Starbucks location ever.

So I was on my way to surprise my boyfriend at his placement and saw this on my way and decided last minute to drop in & if the lines short I'll pick up some drinks to surprise him with. The line had 3 people and no one on the sides waiting for pick up so I thought cool, 7-10 minutes tops. Well I could see that the person in front was kinda annoyed about the wait and I just assumed that the person ordering was probably just indecisive on what to get but over all took like a few minutes to order. At this point there was ONE barista in the back and ONE on cash the other worker was doing some cleaning ... slightly understaffed especially considering I was there at 4:45ish (almost rush hour time) When my order was taken they didn't ask for my name & I didn't realize so I went to wait & I knew what I ordered so it's fine when the drinks came after they took and extremely long time to be made (it was 5:05 and my boyfriend finished placement at 5 so surprise ruined) a girl behind me said she ordered that drink... like yeah you probably did but I ordered first so I proceed to get a trey and put straws in my drinks and then the guy working there called out to me and said miss you picked up someone else's drink and I said I ordered this and he tried saying so did she and the girl that took my order remained silent. I was ready to ask for a full refund at that moment but obviously my boyfriend has been waiting for a while now. In conclusion, I felt very disrespected.

There were 4 giant screens where you have to use your fingers to swipe through the various menus or go back and forth to switch between categories on what you want to order. Each machine also has a credit card reader, a scanner for coupon, and the screens are in a well lit area where the sunlight won't give it glare and make it hard to see. The only down side is that the screens are right at the front door and it's a bit cramp with people with backpacks on. Once you order, you will get your receipt with your number on it and the workers will have your food ready and call out your order.\n\nOne of the local gave me a coupon for a $1 McCafe and I used it on the machine and thinking they will need to take the coupon when I get my food but no, McDonald's worker did not care so the coupon could possibly be used and used again until the expiration date. It was quite interesting to see how the fast food industry will be slowly evolved to with these automated kiosks and still find it interesting that people are still going up to the cashier to order it the old fashion way. I don't feel by any means it made my food come out faster but it does cut out the interaction and one long queue line when you can just line up behind whichever kiosk you want to use next.\n\nThe food, I mean, it's McDonald's, at least they are strictly consist on the taste, the portion, and what makes a McDonald's burger taste like their burger with chopped onion, well done beef patty, s shot of the ketchup and mustard, and with the pickle to round it off.

With the foot long Meatball Marinara, Italian, or Black Forest Ham subs currently going for $4.99, I am a fan. This costs less money than buying frozen processed dinners from the supermarket.\n\nWhile the $4.99 promotion is taking place, I have been frequently taking out the $4.99 Subway Black Forest Ham sub in lieu of buying frozen processed dinners from the supermarket. If it were not for the fact that most of the Subways near my work and home are in parking lots that are a nuisance to navigate, I have also bought the frozen processed supermarket food on the days that I normally do not eat out. What separates this Subway from most of the locations by my work and home is the simplicity of navigating the parking lot which is to the northeast of Interstate 215 and Valle Verde Drive. First off exiting the parking lot is a breeze. There are two sets of traffic signals off Valle Verde Drive by Subway that stop and slow down the cross traffic. This includes the set of traffic lights at Interstate 215 and the Kohl's Shopping Center attached to the Subway parking lot. This has eliminated the nuisance of existing. Second off, it is equally a breeze parking. It is in a pad with a only a few businesses that don't draw crowds at the same time it is close to Valle Verde Drive. This eliminates navigating through a shopping center. \n\n  The times  that I stopped by this Subway were when I was in the vicinity of Cornerstone Park or driving home from east Henderson or Boulder City. They were oftentimes on the days that I normally eat out but wanted to eat in my home. A nice thing about Subway is that I can pick up two days worth of Black Forest Ham subs and store them in the refrigerator to get me through the following evening. \n\n   Everytime that I stopped by this Subway the employees have been fast and professional. And the Black Forest Ham sub has been just the way I ordered: toasted multigrain bread, pepper jack cheese, every topping excluding pickles and banana peppers, topped off with oil, vinegar, mustard, light mayonnaise, and Black pepper.\n\n  With the outstanding $4.99 deal, I am a fan of Subway. After the promotion ends and the Black Forest Ham goes back to $6 and change, I will continue to patronize the chain. Perhaps less frequently. Additionally with the ease of navigating the parking lot, I am also a fan of this location.","address":"40 N Valle Verde Dr, Ste 100","attributes":{"BikeParking":"False","RestaurantsAttire":"u'casual'","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"False","HasTV":"False","GoodForKids":"True","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","OutdoorSeating":"False","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","Ambience":"{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","DriveThru":"False"},"categories":"Restaurants, Sandwiches, Fast Food","city":"Henderson","hours":null,"is_open":1,"latitude":36.0290187,"longitude":-115.0625851,"name":"Subway","postal_code":"89074","review_count":10,"Overall_Rating":3.0,"state":"NV"},{"business_id":"y0hX4WjgQcO2NYR0arD8VQ","date":"2016-06-27T00:00:00.000Z","User_Rating":2,"text":"That hello when you come in the door is nice, but you could tell instantly that the crew was listed enthused about anything having to do with their work.

Ask them anything about your drink or treat!\n\nI know I know its pricy but I like what I get.\n\nI usually get the chai latte. I get it lactose free. They have three options. One - lactose free milk, Two - soy (its nice try it), Three - with coconut milk (its new trying it right now, I like it, doesn't over power). The chai latte is spicy and creamy. Get it without water for a really strong spice kick, that's how I like it. My other go to drink is the cinnamon dulce latte, equally a delight.\n\nTreats, I like the oat fudge bars,scones, and coojies. Chocolate goodness. Ask them to heat it up for you for an extra special treat!\n\nSandwiches, this is going to sound gross but its delicious. I love the Thai tuna wrap - heated up. They'll question if you really want to, but trust me you do! I am also completely obsessed with the the feta and spinach breakfast wrap.
